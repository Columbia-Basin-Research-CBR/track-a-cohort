Each file includes the necessary information to load the data and directs user to which libraries are needed to run the script.\nTo access the final individual plots (.png), navigate to the docs/www/ folder within the repository. The rendered plots are available in respective species folders, TAC_SPECIES_figures_files&gt;figure-html.\nTo view the final data used to generate the plots, navigate to the data folder within the repository. Raw data that supports the data for generating plots and/or tables are available in the data-raw folder and can all be updated at once using the R/update_data.R script. Alternatively, the data will be prompted to update with each new build of the quarto webpage.\nTo render the complete quarto webpage locally, download the repository to R and run the code make in the terminal, or clicking Build in the panel tabs within your R environment. Once complete, navigate to the docs/ folder where you’ll find the rendered webpage: index.html. Open in browser to view the complete webpage.\n\nPlease direct general questions to: web@cbr.washington.edu"
